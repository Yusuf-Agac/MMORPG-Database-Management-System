Dear all,

I am excited to announce the release of my latest project, the MMORPG-Database-Management-System. This project was created to gain competence in database management systems and to develop a database that contains the features required for a typical MMORPG game.

During my research, I realized the importance of the database in the game industry, particularly in the MMORPG genre. As a result, I designed most of the database features that an MMORPG game would need, including Register and Login, Inventory, User Info, Market, and Skills.

To develop this project, I used various technologies, including MAMP, MySql, Unity, PHP, and C#.

I hope that the MMORPG-Database-Management-System will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in database management systems and MMORPG game development.

Sincerely,

YUSUF AGAC

# Unity-MMORPG-Database-Management-System

I wanted to do a unity project to gain competence about database management systems. I did a research and then I realized the importance of the database in the game industry in the MMORPG genre. I designed most database features that an MMORPG game would need.

Features: Register and Login, Inventory, User Info, Market, Clan, Quests

Technologies: MAMP, MySql, Unity, PHP, C#
